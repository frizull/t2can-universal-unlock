# 🚗 T2CAN Universal Unlock v3.7.2

> Universal firmware for supported Tesla Model 3 / Model Y platforms.

## `tmr-universal`: T-2CAN and TMR / Autospeed A23

One firmware image detects the board at boot. GPIO15/16/17 held low by the
A23's 10k resistors select TMR; pins following both internal pulls select
T-2CAN. Unknown or unstable signatures remain in setup mode with CAN disabled.
The default AP is `TMR-xxxx` on A23 and `T2CAN-xxxx` on T-2CAN. Saved custom
SSID/password settings remain authoritative.

| Hardware | Standard Model 3/Y | Model Y L |
|---|---|---|
| TMR / A23 | J2 Body + J3 Chassis + J4 Party, simultaneously | J3 VH + J4 Party; J2 standby |
| T-2CAN | Original Body + Chassis or Party + Chassis profiles | Original Party + VH profile |

A23 uses shared SPI SCK/MOSI/MISO 12/11/13, CS 10/9/8 and standby 18/14/21,
at 500 kbit/s with 16 MHz XL2515 crystals. GPIO9 is **never reset** on A23.
Body and Party reception alternate fairly; their matching numeric CAN IDs are
kept separate. Party TX uses J4 explicitly. A23 Body/Party share upstream's
CAN-A recovery group; Chassis retains a separate queue/recovery path. Existing
LAB A/B capture stays on its original logical buses; C reception counters are
available in `/api/profile/status`.

Build with Arduino CLI, ESP32 core **3.3.11**, and `autowp-mcp2515` **1.3.1**:
`python3 tools/build.py`. The single image is in `build/universal/`; no board
build flag or separate release is needed. `tools/update_profile_ui.py` (Python `zopfli`) updates
the profile script inside the upstream compressed dashboard without changing
its other scripts. Regression and bench-test status: [TMR validation](docs/tmr-validation.md).

Live status is also available over USB without changing Wi-Fi or resetting the
board: `python3 tools/usb_status.py --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101` (use the actual
ESP port). Optional arguments select status paths such as `/api/blinkA/stats`.
The wire protocol is `GET /api/...` followed by a newline, returning one JSON
line with `path` and `data`. It exposes read-only profile, features, Auto Blinker,
DAS, R79, ULC/Auto Lane Change, system and research-capture status from the same
builders as the dashboard, on both TMR and T-2CAN. USB diagnostics do not require
the verbose logging build flag. `/api/canb/txtrace` returns the latest 64 CAN-B
send attempts with sequence, time, ID, payload and enqueue result; it does not
prove the destination controller accepted a command. `/api/ulc/bus-rx` passively
counts received `0x3F8` bit-1 values by physical connector A/B/C, with ages and
the latest payload. Counters span the current boot; an unseen value has count 0.
On TMR, Party is C even when YL maps the upstream CAN-A role to that connector.
The only USB writes are the existing Confirm-Free
timing choices: `--method POST '/api/ulc/update?timing=0'` (AP only) or `timing=1`
(Pre-AP). They persist the selection with rollback on an NVS error. No arbitrary
CAN injection or other settings writes are exposed.

## ✨ What’s new in v3.7.2

- Profile-based Auto Blinker TX defaults:
  - **Model YL:** Single TX
  - **Other supported Model 3/Y profiles:** legacy 350 ms burst
- New persistent LAB experiment: **Disable Driver Monitoring (NAG)** via `0x3FD` mux1 bit 43.
- The LAB NAG setting is saved in NVS, defaults to OFF, and remains experimental.
- Added R79 LAB telemetry for bit 43: stock value, effective value, and RX change counters.


## 🚀 v3.7 Highlights

| Area | Changes |
|---|---|
| AP / NAG decoding | Corrected `0x399` AP and Hands-On decoding, full AP-state validation, and short-frame rejection |
| Auto Blinker | NOA stabilization (1–20 s, default 10 s), cancel pause (10–100 s, default 20 s), and clearer dashboard states |
| Lane-change cancel | Door-open and S3XY cancel work even when the live `0x24A` context remains `IN_LANE` |
| R79 | Fixed production policy: 2 ms mux1 fast echo plus one +150 ms mux2 refresh |
| Summon | SmartSummonOnly bit 18 moved to **Settings → Summon** (`FORCE 0` by default or `STOCK`) |
| NAG Killer | Mode H Rev.4 production defaults and profiles in **Settings → NAG KILLER** |
| AP Right Scroll | Warning recovery for all supported profiles, with 1–5 s repeat interval (default 2 s) |
| Dashboard | New production controls, persistent migrations, firmware identity updated to v3.7 |

## 🚙 Supported profiles

| Configuration | NAG Killer | Advanced EAP | Pedal Map | EU Unlock |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Model YL · Party + VH** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Standard Model 3/Y · Body + Chassis** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Standard Model 3/Y · Party + Chassis** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

> Model 3 Highland requires selecting the installed turn-control type during profile setup. Other supported profiles automatically use the Stalk configuration.

## 🧩 Main features

### 🛡️ Vehicle-profile safety

A saved Vehicle Profile determines the CAN topology, turn-signal route, supported features, and profile-specific restrictions.

On first boot or after a major migration, firmware remains in a fail-closed setup state until a valid profile is saved:

- CAN transmission and injection are disabled.
- CAN recovery supervision is disabled.
- Bluetooth is not started.
- Wi-Fi and the Profile Setup page remain available.

> Migrating from pre-Universal v2.x firmware intentionally erases NVS before creating the Universal bootstrap configuration.

### 🚦 Advanced EAP and Auto Blinker

Advanced EAP can automatically request a turn signal when the vehicle requests a lane change, with configurable delay and retained cancellation options through the screen, door-open action, or S3XY button.

Auto Blinker is profile-aware and validates the requested direction before transmission:

- `DAS_autoLaneChangeState` must permit the requested left or right maneuver.
- The condition is checked when the request is armed and again when it fires.
- A lane becoming unavailable during the delay cancels the pending action.
- NOA must remain eligible through the configured stabilization interval.
- Door-open or S3XY cancellation can apply a shared, configurable pause; triggering cancel again releases it early.

> Direct S3XY left/right blinker actions remain independent from the Auto Blinker enable, stabilization, and pause states.

### 🔁 R79 and Summon

The production R79 path applies a fixed policy to accepted stock frames:

- `UI_applyEceR79` bit 19: forced to `0`.
- `UI_hardCoreSummon` bit 47: forced to `1`.
- SmartSummonOnly bit 18: selectable in **Settings → Summon** as `FORCE 0` or `STOCK`.

Each accepted stock mux1 frame is echoed with a bounded 2 ms queue wait. Each accepted mux2 frame schedules one +150 ms refresh. The LAB page now exposes a read-only R79 status card rather than transport/timing experiments.

A separate always-on Summon Monitor provides state observation, gate telemetry, ACA/SPR monitoring, park-state monitoring, and queue/transport telemetry.

### 💪 NAG Killer and AP Right Scroll

NAG Killer remains profile-gated. Mode H Rev.4 is available as a production profile in **Settings → NAG KILLER** with these defaults:

- Primary: 1.80–2.60 Nm
- Wait: 0.90–3.00 s
- Refractory: 0.50–1.50 s
- Opposite carrier: 0.10–0.60 Nm
- Tiered Hands-On thresholds: 0.40 / 2.00 Nm
- Visual Warning Rescue: ON after 0.5 s
- Hard pause while stopped

AP Right Scroll is available in Settings for Model YL and standard Model 3/Y profiles. A newly detected visual warning triggers an immediate UP/DOWN pair; if the warning stays active, it repeats every 1–5 seconds (default: 2 seconds). Physical right-scroll input always has priority.

### 🔘 S3XY Button support

- Register up to **three S3XY Buttons**.
- Enable or disable Bluetooth Master at runtime without rebooting.
- Saved devices, bonds, button mappings, and Auto Connect settings are retained.
- S3XY actions can control direct blinkers, lane-change cancellation, and CAN research capture.

## 🧪 Dashboard and LAB

The mobile dashboard has four persistent sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **HOME** | Status and quick controls |
| **DEVICES** | S3XY / Bluetooth devices |
| **SETTINGS** | Supported production features and system configuration |
| **LAB** | Experimental tools and CAN research |

### 🔬 LAB tools

> ⚠️ LAB is intended for controlled research only.

- Read-only R79 status and bit telemetry.
- Experimental **Disable Driver Monitoring (NAG)** control using `0x3FD` mux1 bit 43, where supported.
- ULC Blind Spot research modes: Stock, Standard, Aggressive, and Mad Max.
- Auto Lane Change experiment.
- CAN capture: Snapshot, Raw Transition, and Auto ALC Transition.

> CAN Research Capture is RX-only: it observes and exports CAN traffic but does not replay captured frames.

## 📶 Wi-Fi and resets

### 📡 Wi-Fi access point

Default access point:

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| SSID | `T2CAN-****` |
| Password | `12345678` |
| Dashboard | [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1) |

SSID and password can be changed from the dashboard. Applying a Wi-Fi change restarts only the access point; CAN, BLE, and the MCU continue running.

### ♻️ Reset options

| Action | What it clears | What it preserves |
|---|---|---|
| Reset Firmware Settings | Normal firmware settings | Vehicle profile, Wi-Fi, and S3XY/Bluetooth data |
| Reset Bluetooth Data | S3XY registry, mappings, bonds, discovery/cache | Bluetooth Master and Global Auto Connect settings |
| Factory Reset | All NVS data | Nothing; returns to Vehicle Profile Setup |

## 🔧 Hardware note

> ⚠️ Remove the two **120 Ω termination resistors** if they are not appropriate for your wiring. Leaving them in place can cause CAN signal errors.
